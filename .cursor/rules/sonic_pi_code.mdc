# Sonic Pi Code Examples

## Retrowave Ambient (120 BPM)
```ruby
use_bpm 120

with_fx :reverb, mix: 0.7, room: 0.9 do
  with_fx :echo, mix: 0.4, decay: 8, phase: 0.5 do
    live_loop :retro_chords do
      use_synth :prophet
      chord_progression = [
        chord(:E3, :m7),
        chord(:C3, :major7),
        chord(:A3, :m7), 
        chord(:D3, '7')
      ]
      
      chord_progression.each do |c|
        play c, release: 4, cutoff: 80, amp: 0.7
        sleep 4
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Interstellar-Inspired Ambient (60 BPM)
```ruby
use_bpm 60

with_fx :reverb, mix: 0.9, room: 0.95 do
  live_loop :organ_pattern do
    use_synth :blade
    notes = (ring :c4, :c4, :g3, :g3)
    times = (ring 1, 1, 1, 1)
    
    play notes.tick, amp: 0.6
    sleep times.look
  end
  
  live_loop :clock_ticks, sync: :organ_pattern do
    use_synth :beep
    pattern = (ring 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0)
    8.times do |i|
      play :e5, release: 0.1, amp: 0.2 * pattern[i]
      sleep 0.5
    end
  end
end
